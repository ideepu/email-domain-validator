# Package Management with `uv`

These rules define strict guidelines for managing Python dependencies in this project using the `uv` dependency manager.

## Use `uv` exclusively

- All Python dependencies **must be installed, synchronized, and locked** using `uv`.
- Never use `pip`, `pip-tools`, or `poetry` directly for dependency management.

## Use latest package versions

- When **adding** dependencies, use the **latest** available version: run `uv add <package>` **without** a version pin so `uv` resolves the latest release.
- When **upgrading** existing dependencies to latest, run `uv lock --upgrade` then `uv sync` (or `uv add <package> --upgrade` per package).
- Do not pin to an old version in `pyproject.toml` unless there is a known compatibility reason; prefer minimum bounds (e.g. `>=3.0.0`) only when necessary for the project’s supported range.

## Managing dependencies

```bash
# Add dependency at latest version (no pin)
uv add <package>

# Upgrade all dependencies to latest and refresh lockfile
uv lock --upgrade
uv sync

# Remove dependency
uv remove <package>

# Reinstall from lock file
uv sync
```
