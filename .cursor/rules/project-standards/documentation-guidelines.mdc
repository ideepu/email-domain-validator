# Documentation Guidelines

General open source documentation standards. Apply when writing or editing README, CONTRIBUTING, changelogs, or Cursor rules/skills.

Use the writing documentation skill `.cursor/skills/writing-documentation/SKILL.md`

## Structure and clarity

- **One main idea per section.** Use clear headings (sentence case or title case; pick one and stay consistent).
- **Lead with purpose.** README: what the project does, who it’s for, and how to run/use it in under a minute.
- **Code examples:** Use fenced code blocks with language tags (e.g. ` ```bash `, ` ```python `). Show minimal, runnable examples.
- **Docs as code.** Prefer Markdown; keep docs in the repo and review them in the same PRs as code changes.

## Required docs (open source)

- **README:** Purpose, install/quick start, basic usage, link to CONTRIBUTING and license.
- **LICENSE:** Clear and present at repo root.
- **CONTRIBUTING** (optional but recommended): How to set up, run tests, and submit changes.
- **CHANGELOG** (optional): Human-readable list of notable changes per version for users and maintainers.

## Style and inclusivity

- Use plain language; avoid jargon unless the audience expects it.
- Prefer inclusive wording (e.g. “they” as neutral, “allowlist/denylist” where appropriate).
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short. Use lists for steps or options.

## Maintenance

- Update docs when behavior or APIs change; treat doc updates as part of the change.
- Don’t duplicate the same information in many places; link to a single source of truth.
- For Cursor rules and skills: keep them concise; reference other rule/skill files instead of inlining long content.
