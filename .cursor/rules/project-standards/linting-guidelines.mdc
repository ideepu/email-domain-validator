# Linting guidelines

## General

- Use the linting skill `.cursor/skills/linting/SKILL.md`
- Always run the linters in virtual env and with pre commit
- Run individual linters only when explicitly asked
- Always keep the linters configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- Ask before updating the configuration in `pyproject.toml`

- **Use pre-commit for managing linters.**
All lint checks run via pre-commit. Install hooks with `pre-commit install`;
Run run manually with `pre-commit run --all-files`.Always take the linters configration from `pyproject.toml` and refer the pre-commit linters to `pyproject.toml` config. If linters are failed, try `pre-commit autoupdate` and then run the linters again. If the linters still fail, then try resolving the issues as per the guidelines

## Individual linters

- **Ruff**: Primary linter and formatter for Python. Use project config in `pyproject.toml`; run `ruff check` and `ruff format` (or via pre-commit).
- **Pylint**: Use for extra static checks. Config in `pyproject.toml`; run in pre-commit
- **Mypy**: Use for type checking. Config in `pyproject.toml`; run in pre-commit.
- **Markdownlint**: Use for Markdown. Config via `.markdownlint.yaml` or in pre-commit args; enforce in pre-commit.

## Running

- Pre-commit: Run `pre-commit run --all-files` (or rely on the git hook), if failed run `pre-commit autoupdate` and run `pre-commit run --all-files` then proceed.
- Individual tools (full paths / from project root): `ruff check .`, `ruff format .`, `pylint src/`, `mypy src/`, `markdownlint '**/*.md'` (or as in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).
