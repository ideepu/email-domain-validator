# General Rules

Apply to all Cursor behavior: rules, code suggestions, chat replies, edits, completions, and any other guidance.

---

## Be concise and direct

- **Keep explanations short.** Prefer brief, actionable answers. Avoid long messages unless they are needed.
- **Use judgment.** Expand only when it’s important—e.g. non-obvious reasoning, security/correctness, or user explicitly asking for detail. For routine fixes or clear requests, a short summary or inline comment is enough.
- **Don’t over-explain by default.** Skip lengthy preambles, repeated caveats, and step-by-step narration for simple tasks. If in doubt, err on the side of concise.

## Rule organization (when creating or editing project rules)

When creating, updating, or describing project rules, follow this structure:

### 1. Group rules together

- Keep all Cursor rule files at the **repo root** (this project is for prepping rules; no `.cursor` folder).
- Keep related docs together (e.g. `project-standards.mdc`, `rules-management.mdc` at root). The canonical list of rule *references* lives in the main file.

### 2. Keep rules separate

- **One concern per file.** Use separate rule files for distinct topics (e.g. `testing-guidelines.mdc`, `rules-management.mdc`, file-specific rules by glob).
- Do not merge unrelated rules into a single file.

### 3. Refer rules in the main file

- **Main file:** `.cursor/rules/Guidelines.mdc` at the repo root. List each rule file there with a short label and path; do not copy full content into `cursor/rules/Guidelines.mdc`.
- When adding a new rule file, add a corresponding entry in `cursor/rules/Guidelines.mdc` or associated sub rule file wherever it suits the best to follow the existing strucuture.
- When using the skill for a any rule read the general guidelines from `.cursor/skills/README.mdc`

Example in `cursor/rules/Guidelines.mdc`:

```markdown
- **Topic or label**  
  → `rule-file.mdc`
```
