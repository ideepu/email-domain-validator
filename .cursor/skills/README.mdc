# Project skills

Cursor **skills** in this directory teach the agent how to perform specific tasks for this project. They are separate from **rules** (see `.cursor/rules/Guidelines.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/`), which define standards and conventions.

## Directory layout

Each skill is a subdirectory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```text
.cursor/skills/
├── README.md
└── skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md           # Required – main instructions
    ├── reference.md       # Optional – detailed docs
    └── scripts/           # Optional – utility scripts
```

## SKILL.md format

Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and a markdown body:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it (third person; include trigger terms)
---

# Skill title

## Instructions
Step-by-step guidance for the agent.
```

- **name**: lowercase, letters/numbers/hyphens only, max 64 chars.
- **description**: non-empty, max 1024 chars; include both *what* the skill does and *when* the agent should use it so the agent can discover it.

## Adding a skill

1. Create a subdirectory: `.cursor/skills/your-skill-name/`.
2. Add `SKILL.md` with the frontmatter and instructions.
3. Optionally add `reference.md` or `scripts/` for extra docs or runnable helpers.

## Best practices

- Keep `SKILL.md` under ~500 lines; put long reference material in separate files.
- Write the description in third person with clear trigger terms (e.g. “Use when working with SPF/DKIM/DMARC…”).
- Prefer one concern per skill; use multiple skills instead of one large file.
- Use consistent terminology and concrete examples.

## Relation to rules

- **Rules** (`.cursor/rules/`, `Guidelines.mdc`): coding standards, dependencies, validation patterns, security — applied per conversation or by glob.
- **Skills** (this directory): task-specific workflows the agent can invoke when relevant (e.g. “run email domain checks”, “generate a validation report”).
