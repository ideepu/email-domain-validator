# Writing project documentation

Use when creating or editing project docs for users and contributors.
Follow the project's documentation guidelines.

## Project documentation guidelines

- Read and apply: `.cursor/rules/project-standards/documentation-guidelines.mdc`
- Covers: structure, clarity, required docs (README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING,
  CHANGELOG), style, and maintenance.

## When to use this skill

- User asks to document the project, write or improve README, CONTRIBUTING,
  or CHANGELOG.
- User asks for user-facing docs, contributor docs, or "docs for the project."
- User asks to add or update installation, usage, or contribution
  instructions.

## Scope (project docs only)

- **README:** What the project does, who it's for, install/quick start, basic
  usage, links to CONTRIBUTING and license.
- **CONTRIBUTING:** How to set up the repo, run tests, and submit changes.
- **CHANGELOG:** Notable changes per version for users and maintainers.
- **Other:** API docs, architecture notes, or any Markdown in the repo
  intended for humans (not Cursor rules/skills).

## Workflow

1. **Identify scope:** Which doc(s)—README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, or
   other.
2. **Apply documentation guidelines:** One idea per section, lead with
   purpose, fenced code with language tags, plain and inclusive language,
   single source of truth.
3. **Write or edit** in Markdown; keep examples minimal and runnable.
4. **Verify:** Links work, code blocks have language tags, no duplicated
   content across files.
